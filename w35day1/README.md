### This site uses cookies
Remember these annoying "this-site-uses-cookies-to-continue-please-accept-our-terms" things?

Now it's your turn.

### Your task
Create a small site that does the following.

1. when the page loads, an element (div?) slides up/in containing the cookie notification
2. When a button is pressed, it slides back out

You do not need to implement cookies (and cookies are horrible to work with in JS).

If you feel like doing a bit more, take a look at a newer alternative to cookies called [`localStorage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) that's way easier to work with
